MongoMapper documents are the equivalent of models in ActiveRecord. An instantiated "MongoMapper::Document":/documentation/documents/document.html class represents a single document in a MongoDB collection. It also provides a number of class methods used for "querying the collection":/documentation/plugins/querying.html itself. You can embed documents inside other documents (rather than in their own collections) using the "MongoMapper::EmbeddedDocument":/documentation/documents/embedded-document.html class.
