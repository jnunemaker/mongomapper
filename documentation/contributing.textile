h3. Guidelines

In order to maintain quality, here are some guidelines for contributing to the MongoMapper documentation.

* Don't document hacks or workarounds. If MongoMapper is broken or doesn't support something, note it in the docs and add an issue to the "issue tracker":http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/issues.
* Avoid narratives. People don't really care why you're writing the documentation, they just want to know how to use MongoMapper.
* Be concise without sacrificing clarity.
