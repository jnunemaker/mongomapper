Using MongoMapper with Rails 3 is easier than ever. Thanks to new features in ActiveSupport, and the new ActiveModel framework (which MongoMapper 0.9+ uses), your app can be up and running on MongoDB in a matter of seconds.

First, if you're generating a new Rails 3 application, it is recommended to leave out the ActiveRecord dependencies (unless you need them of course). From the console, just run:

{% highlight bash %}
rails new my_app --skip-active-record
{% endhighlight %}

But, not everyone is starting fresh. If you're converting an existing Rails 3 application from ActiveRecord (or another ORM), simply open @config/application.rb@ and replace

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rails/all'
{% endhighlight %}

with

{% highlight ruby %}
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "active_resource/railtie"
require "rails/test_unit/railtie"
# Uncomment for asset pipelining in Rails 3.1
# require "sprockets/railtie"
{% endhighlight %}

For Rails 3.2 you also need to disable next code in files:

* @config/environments/development.rb@

{% highlight ruby %}
config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict
config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = 0.5
{% endhighlight %}

* @config/environments/test.rb@

{% highlight ruby %}
config.active_record.mass_assignment_sanitizer = :strict
{% endhighlight %}

* @config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb@

{% highlight ruby %}
ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do
  self.include_root_in_json = false
end
{% endhighlight %}

Next, add MongoMapper to your @Gemfile@, and run @bundle install@:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'mongo_mapper'
gem 'bson_ext'
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you're almost ready to go, but you still need some configuration info. Generate @config/mongo.yml@ by running:

{% highlight bash %}
script/rails generate mongo_mapper:config
{% endhighlight %}

(Note: in versions of MongoMapper below 0.9+, you were required to implement any configuration files manually using an initializer. This is now resolved, and requires nothing more on your part.)

Technically, you can initialize MongoMapper and use it to store data now. However, I like to configure Rails' model generator. Inside of the Application class (@config/application.rb@) I add:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.generators do |g|
  g.orm :mongo_mapper
end
{% endhighlight %}

This will allow you to use the @rails generate model@ command with MongoMapper.

You're now finished, go forth and create!
