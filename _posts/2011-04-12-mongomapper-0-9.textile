After months of hard work rewriting MongoMappers internals to use ActiveModel, MongoMapper 0.9 is finally here.

This release support Rails 3 only. There may be one or two more 0.8.x maintenance releases for Rails 2, but the future of MongoMapper is focused on Rails 3.

h2. Credits

Thanks to everyone that contributed to this release. Especially Brian Ryckbost and Chris Gaffney at "Collective Idea":http://collectiveidea.com for starting the rails3 branch and doing the grunt of the initial work.

h2. Roadmap

The 0.9 series will hopefully be very short-lived, with 1.0 coming soon. But before we can get to 1.0, we have a "handful of issues":https://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper/issues?milestone=1&state=open to resolve and a lot of "documentation to write":/documentation/contributing.html. So go "fork the repo":http://github.com/jnunemaker/mongomapper and lend a hand!
